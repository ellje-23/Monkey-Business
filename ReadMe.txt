1. What bugs and conceptual difficulties did you encounter? How did you overcome them? What did you learn?
    Probability distribution representation
    I struggled with the concept of how to represent each distribution. Once I figured out that out, it was
    then the issue of figuring out how to access each individual probability.

    Rounding off problem
    It was frustrating that you couldn't represent an 8 digit constantly. Each time it would get rid of 0's
    or round incorrectly.

2. Describe whatever help (if any) that you received. Don’t include readings, lectures, and exercises, but do
include any help from other sources, such as websites or people (including classmates and friends) and
attribute them by name.
    NA

3. Describe any serious problems you encountered while writing the program.
    The rounding off problem was the biggest issue I had.
